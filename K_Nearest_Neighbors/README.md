# K Nearest Neighbors Algorithm #

**Welcome to the KNN Project!**

In statistics, the k-nearest neighbors algorithm (KNN) is a non-parametric classification method first developed by Evelyn Fix and Joseph Hodges in 1951 [[1](https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a800276.pdf)], and later expanded by Thomas Cover [[2](https://ecommons.cornell.edu/bitstream/handle/1813/31637/BU-1065-MA.pdf;jsessionid=12B5FEF9A497967A48EA88719B24D980?sequence=1)]. It is used for classification and regression. In both cases, the input consists of the k closest training examples in a data set.


In this section, a project on KNN algorithm is presented.
